    This function, run_cmd_advanced_training, dynamically constructs a command line string for advanced training

    arguments, appending them to the command line string with appropriate formatting.

    Purpose
        The primary purpose of this function is to enable flexible and customizable training configurations for machine
        learning models. It allows users to specify a wide range of parameters and flags that control various aspects of
        the training process, such as learning rates, batch sizes, augmentation options, precision settings, and many more.

    Returns:
